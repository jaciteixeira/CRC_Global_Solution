introdution=The solution allows residents to register their electricity bills monthly. Based on consumption, the platform calculates each resident's energy efficiency and assigns points according to their savings efforts. These points can be accumulated and later redeemed through benefits provided by the condominium, such as discounts on condominium fees, access to leisure areas, or participation in raffles for sustainable items. The platform also includes a dashboard for the condominium, where administrators can monitor overall performance, register available benefits, and encourage sustainable practices among residents, creating a cycle of awareness and rewards that benefits the entire community. This initiative aims to reduce energy consumption, promote sustainability, and strengthen collaboration among residents for a greener future.
